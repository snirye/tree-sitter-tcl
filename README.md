# tree-sitter-tcl

This repository provides a [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for the [Tcl](https://www.tcl-lang.org/) programming language.

## Overview
This project implements a parser for Tcl, following the official [Summary of Tcl language syntax](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.6.13/TclCmd/Tcl.htm). The grammar is designed to be used with the tree-sitter parsing library, enabling fast and robust parsing, syntax highlighting, and code analysis for Tcl source code.

## Features
- Comprehensive coverage of Tcl syntax as described in the official documentation
- Multi-language bindings: C, Go, Node.js, Python, Rust, Swift, and Zig
- Suitable for use in editors, IDEs, and code analysis tools
